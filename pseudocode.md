### AlphaZeroConfig Class

```python
class AlphaZeroConfig(object):
  def __init__(self):
    # Self-Play
    self.num_actors = 5000
    self.num_sampling_moves = 30
    self.max_moves = 512
    self.num_simulations = 800
    self.root_dirichlet_alpha = 0.3
    self.root_exploration_fraction = 0.25
    self.pb_c_base = 19652
    self.pb_c_init = 1.25

    # Training
    self.training_steps = int(700e3)
    self.checkpoint_interval = int(1e3)
    self.window_size = int(1e6)
    self.batch_size = 4096
    self.weight_decay = 1e-4
    self.momentum = 0.9
    self.learning_rate_schedule = {
        0: 2e-1,
        100e3: 2e-2,
        300e3: 2e-3,
        500e3: 2e-4
    }
```

- Configuration class for AlphaZero algorithm.
- Defines hyperparameters for both self-play and training phases.
- Specifies the number of actors (self-play processes), exploration parameters, and training-related parameters such as steps, intervals, window size, batch size, weight decay, momentum, and learning rate schedule.
- Attributes:
  - num_actors: Determines how many parallel actors will be trained. This is a parallelization feature that we have little use for. It used in the `alphazero()` function. It will most likely be removed.
  - num_sample_moves: Controls the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. If less than num_sample_moves have been made through the game, the action is sampled using a softmax function. If more than that amount of moves has been performed, the action taken is the one with the maximum number of visits, favouring exploitation. Used in the `select_action()`
  - max_moves: This parameter determines how many moves a game can have during the self-play phase. It is used in the `play_game()` function. With this, we can limit the amount of decisions we assign to an episode.
  - max_simulations: Determines the number of times the tree search is run every step. That is, the number of simulations that occur from the root state to either a terminal state or to a number of steps greater than the limit. Used in `run_mcts()`.
  - root_dirichlet_alpha and root_exploration_fraction: These paramaters are used in `add_exploration_noise()` to control the amount of exploration of the action space.
