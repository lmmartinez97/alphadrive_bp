    "The class SceneData contains the information of a single csv tuple (tracks, tracks metadata and video metadata). It handles data transformation from track information (in a per-vehicle trajectory basis) to parallel information, that is, which vehicles are present in the scene at each frame of the recording. It also handles distinction based on driving direction, so that vehicles in diferent roadways can be identified and field calculation is not impeded by taking into account vehicles driving in the other direction of the freeway.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also contains a method to display or save a .gif reconstruction of the csv tuple. Beware, this reconstruction takes a long while to process, since the function that plots each frame of the animation is rather slow to execute - for the moment, no more work will be performed on it, but it is still considered to be a WIP.\n",

    "The class will be updated with whatever additions are considered to extract the potential field that will be used to train the autoencoder further down the pipeline. Each major addition will have a corresponding subsection in this notebook. The goal is, then, to create a class that contains every transformation necessary, so that it can be then uploaded to the DGX server, which will be much faster in processing the information.\n",
